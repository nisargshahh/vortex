          Bayesian belief network is key computer technology for dealing with probabilistic events and to solve a problem which has uncertainty. We can define a Bayesian network as:
          A Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model which represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies using a directed acyclic graph."
          It is also called a Bayes network, belief network, decision network, or Bayesian model.
          Bayesian networks are probabilistic, because these networks are built from a probability distribution, and also use probability theory for prediction and anomaly detection.
          Real world applications are probabilistic in nature, and to represent the relationship between multiple events, we need a Bayesian network. It can also be used in various tasks including prediction, anomaly detection, diagnostics, automated insight, reasoning, time series prediction, and decision making under uncertainty.

          <p>
            Node is a representation of a random variable in a Bayesian network. Odds A ratio of the probability that an event will happen to the probability that it will not happen. Posterior distribution A probability distribution of a random variable composed of the prior distribution and the likelihood function of the data

            <u1>
              <li>1. To add the first link, click the Link button on the Network tab, Editing group. This will launch the New link window.</li>
              <li>2. Select Gender as the From node.</li>
              <li>3. Select Hair Length as the To node.</li>

              <li>8.  This will launch the Distribution editor.</li>
              <li>9.  In the table on the left, click the cell corresponding to Gender=Female, containing the value 1.</li>
              <li>10. Enter the for P(Height | Gender=Female) in the table on the right.</li>
              <li>11. In the table on the left, click the cell corresponding to Gender=Male, containing the value 1.</li>
